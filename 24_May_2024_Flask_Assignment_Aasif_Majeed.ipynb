    "### Q1. What is a Web API?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Web API (Web Application Programming Interface)** is a set of rules/endpoints that allows one software system (the **client**) to communicate with another system (the **server**) over the web (usually over HTTP/HTTPS).\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it provides**\n",
    "- A URL (endpoint) to access a resource or functionality.\n",
    "- A request/response contract: what data you send and what you get back.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**\n",
    "- Weather app calls an API endpoint like `/weather?city=Philadelphia` and receives JSON data (temperature, humidity, etc.).\n"

    "\n",
    "A **web service** is a broad term for any service available over a network. A **Web API** is a specific type of interface exposed over the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common classroom-style difference:\n",
    "- **Web service**: often refers to older standards like **SOAP** services (XML-based, strict contracts, WSDL).\n",
    "- **Web API**: often refers to modern **REST** or HTTP-based APIs (JSON, simpler, resource-based).\n",
    "\n",
    "**In practice**\n",
    "- Many REST APIs are also “web services,” but the term “web service” is often used for SOAP-based services in industry discussions.\n",

    "- SOAP: `POST /Service` with XML envelope.\n",

    "   - Different apps (mobile/web/desktop) can use the same backend services.\n",

    "   - One API can serve many clients (web app, mobile app, partner systems).\n",
    "3. **Scalability**\n",
    "   - API-based architecture supports microservices and scaling parts independently.\n",
    "4. **Automation**\n",
    "   - Systems can exchange data automatically (no manual file sharing).\n",
    "5. **Faster development**\n",
    "   - Teams can build front-end and back-end in parallel using a clear contract.\n",
    "6. **Ecosystem building**\n",
    "   - Public APIs enable third parties to build apps (e.g., Google Maps API).\n",
