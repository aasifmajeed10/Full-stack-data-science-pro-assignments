The `__init__` method initializes these attributes when a new instance of the class is created.\n",

        "\n",
        "- **Withdraw Method**: Similarly,  define a method named `withdraw` to withdraw money from the account. This method takes an amount as input, checks if it's within the available balance and greater than zero, subtracts it from the balance if valid, and prints a message confirming the withdrawal along with the new balance. If the withdrawal amount is invalid or exceeds the available balance, an appropriate message is printed.\n",
